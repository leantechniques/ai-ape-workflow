# PLANNING MODE

**Purpose**: Know WHAT to build. Design HOW to build it.

---

## What Is This Mode?

**Planning creates**:
- ATOMIC task breakdown
- TDD approach
- Success criteria
- Implementation roadmap

**Assumes**:
- ‚úÖ Architecture decided (exploration complete)
- ‚úÖ Clear goal/spec
- ‚úÖ Ready to design approach

**Not for**:
- Architectural discussions (exploration)
- Writing code (implementation)
- Questioning whether to build (exploration)

---

## Start Checklist

### 1. Read Brief

**Check `briefs/` directory for `P[phase]_[category]_[feature].md`**

**Read**:
- Intent (the why)
- Constraints (what can't change)
- Signal (success criteria)
- Exploration Findings ‚Üí **Planning Input** (what to build)

### 2. Load Context

**From brief's architecture tags** ‚Üí Navigate to relevant docs via `docs/TAG_INDEX.json`

Ensures plan aligns with architectural decisions.

### 3. Present to Human

**Template**:
> "Goal: [state it]. Creating ATOMIC task plan. Starting with context gathering."

---

## Planning Workflow

**Note**: This section describes the 4-step **planning process** (how to create a plan). Your actual **implementation plan** should have as many phases as needed based on units of change - small and tight.

### Step 1: Context Gathering

**Goal**: Understand what exists

- Identify files to read
- Understand current implementation
- **Map dependencies** (CRITICAL - see Dependencies section below)
- Identify test coverage gaps

**Don't write code yet.**

### Step 2: Create Plan

**Structure**:
```markdown
## Goal
[What we're building and why]

## Success Criteria
[How we know it works]

## Dependencies
[What must complete before what - prevents blocking]

## Tasks (ATOMIC - organized by phases)

#### Phase A: [Name] - [Small unit of change]
1. [ ] Write Test: [specific behavior A1]
2. [ ] Implement: [make A1 test pass]
3. [ ] Write Test: [specific behavior A2]
4. [ ] Implement: [make A2 test pass]
5. [ ] **Run tests**: Verify all green
6. [ ] **Commit**: "[Phase A summary]"
7. [ ] **STOP**: End session, resume at Phase B

#### Phase B: [Name] - [Another small unit of change]
8. [ ] Write Test: [specific behavior B1]
9. [ ] Implement: [make B1 test pass]
10. [ ] **Run tests**: Verify all green
11. [ ] **Commit**: "[Phase B summary]"
12. [ ] **STOP**: End session, resume at Phase C

[Continue with as many phases as needed - each phase = one small, tight unit of change]
...
```

**Phase Guidelines**:
- Each phase = ONE small, coherent unit of change
- It's better to have MORE phases (10-15 small ones) than fewer large ones (3-4)
- Each phase should be independently committable
- Don't artificially limit yourself to a fixed number of phases

**üö® CRITICAL TDD Pattern**:
- **Within each phase**: Alternate Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement (TDD pairs)
- **NOT**: All tests first, then all implementations
- **Run tests** after completing all TDD pairs in phase
- Each test-implement pair should be small and focused

**üö® CRITICAL: Every phase MUST end with**:
- **Run tests** task (verify all green after all TDD pairs)
- **Commit** task (preserve state)
- **STOP** task (explicit session boundary)

### Step 3: Present and Iterate

**Present**:
- Plan summary
- Task count
- Risks/unknowns

**Ask**: "Does this plan look good, or should I make changes?"

**Wait for EXPLICIT approval**:
- ‚úÖ "Yes, proceed" / "Looks good, commit it" / "Approve"
- ‚úÖ "Make these changes: ..." (iterate, then re-present)
- ‚ùå Discussion about plan scope/size is NOT approval
- ‚ùå "I like it" without "proceed/commit" is NOT approval

**If unclear**: Ask "Should I commit this plan, or make changes first?"

**Iterate until explicitly approved.**

### Step 4: Commit and Prompt

**ONLY after explicit approval** ("Yes, commit" / "Proceed" / "Looks good, commit it"):

1. **Update brief's "Planning Output"**:
   - Copy full task list (all tasks with checkboxes)
   - Include dependencies section
   - Include implementation approach
   - Mark planning status complete
   - Keep CURRENT MODE as planning

2. **Commit and push**:
   - Add brief with planning output
   - Commit message: "Planning: Brief XX - [title]"
   - Push to remote

3. **Ask what's next**:
   - "Plan committed and pushed. What would you like to do next?"
   - "Options: 1) Start implementation 2) End session 3) Something else"

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT auto-start implementation. DO NOT use TodoWrite. WAIT for human to choose next action.

**Planning typically ends here** (human saves context for fresh implementation session).

---

## Critical: Dependency Mapping

**Key principle**: Tasks frequently have dependency issues when dependencies aren't explicitly mapped up front.

### What to Map

- Which tasks depend on others?
- Which phases must complete before others start?
- What order minimizes blocking?
- What can run in parallel?

### How to Map

**In Planning Output, create Dependencies section**:

```markdown
## Dependencies

### Phase A (Foundation)
- Task 1 ‚Üí Task 2 (Task 2 needs Task 1 output)
- Task 3 (parallel to 1-2, independent)

### Phase B (Builds on A)
- Requires: Phase A complete
- Task 4 ‚Üí Task 5 ‚Üí Task 6

### Phase C (Validation)
- Requires: Phase B complete
- All validation tasks (can run parallel)
```

**Wrong ordering causes**:
- Implementation blocked mid-work
- Context switching between unrelated work
- Rework when dependencies discovered late

---

## Best Practices

### Test-First Always (TDD Cycle)

**Every implement task must be preceded by a test task.**

**The TDD rhythm**: Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement ‚Üí Test ‚Üí Implement

**NOT**: Test, Test, Test ‚Üí Implement, Implement, Implement

| Good (TDD) | Bad (No TDD) |
|------|-----|
| 1. Write Test: Button renders<br>2. Implement: Button component<br>3. Write Test: Button handles clicks<br>4. Implement: Click handler | 1. Write Test: Button renders<br>2. Write Test: Button handles clicks<br>3. Write Test: Button has variants<br>4. Implement: Button component |

**Key principle**: Each test-implement pair should be small and focused. Run tests after implementation to verify green before moving to next test.

### Keep ATOMIC

| Too Big | ATOMIC (TDD pairs) |
|---------|--------|
| Implement JavaScript compiler | 1. Write Test: Parse function declaration<br>2. Implement: Function declaration parsing<br>3. **Run tests** (verify green)<br>4. Write Test: Compile function to method<br>5. Implement: Function to method compilation<br>6. **Run tests** (verify green)<br>7. Break down further into smaller pieces |

### Plan Validation

Include end-to-end validation:
- Run all tests
- Build/run application
- Verify system-level behavior
- Manual validation (if applicable)

### TDD for Unknowns

Unsure how something works? Plan investigative test first.

## Transitioning to Implementation

**Typically happens in NEW SESSION** (preserves context).

**Workflow**:
- Planning session: Plan ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí End
- **New** implementation session: Load plan ‚Üí Create todos for one phase ‚Üí Implement that phase

**Single-Phase Cycle** (Recommended):
- Session 1: TodoWrite Phase A tasks ‚Üí Implement Phase A ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí End
- Session 2: TodoWrite Phase B tasks ‚Üí Implement Phase B ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí End
- Session 3: TodoWrite Phase C tasks ‚Üí Implement Phase C ‚Üí Commit ‚Üí End
- [Continue for as many phases as your plan has]

**Benefits**:
- Natural breakpoints every phase
- Clear "done" signal (phase complete + tests pass)
- Lower context drift risk
- Easy to resume (next session = next phase)

**If human requests implementation in same session**:
1. Convert first phase to TodoWrite todos (one phase only)
2. Update brief CURRENT MODE ‚Üí implementation
3. Follow implementation mode workflow
4. Implement that phase
5. Commit phase, ask if continuing or ending session

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Starting implementation | Code before approval | Get explicit approval first |
| Tasks too large | "Implement entire compiler" | Break to small, focused pieces |
| No test tasks | Only implementation, no tests | Every implement needs test before it |
| Skipping validation | Ends with feature, no system check | Include end-to-end validation |
| **Not updating brief** | **Plan never written to brief** | **ALWAYS update brief's Planning Output** |
| **Not committing plan** | **Jump to implementation** | **Always commit plan before asking next step** |
| **Auto-transition** | **Start implementing after approval** | **Commit, ask what's next, WAIT** |
| **Using TodoWrite in planning** | **Skips commit step** | **TodoWrite is ONLY for implementation mode** |
| **Interpreting discussion as approval** | **"I like it" ‚â† "commit it"** | **Ask: "Should I commit this plan?"** |
| Missing dependencies | Tasks have blocking issues | Map dependencies explicitly |

---

## Example Session

1. Read brief's Exploration Findings (Planning Input)
2. Load arch context (via tags from docs/TAG_INDEX.json)
3. **Step 1** (Context): Read relevant source files, understand structure
4. **Step 2** (Plan): Create ATOMIC tasks across implementation phases, map dependencies
5. **Step 3** (Present):
   - "Here's the plan: [X] tasks across [Y] phases, dependencies mapped"
   - "Does this plan look good, or should I make changes?"
   - Human: "This is a lot of steps"
   - AI: "You're right. Should I: 1) Make it smaller 2) Keep it but commit for review 3) Something else?"
   - Human: "Keep it but commit for review"
   - ‚úÖ **Explicit approval received**
6. **Step 4** (Commit):
   - Update brief's Planning Output (copy all tasks with checkboxes)
   - Commit: "Planning: Brief [number] - [title]"
   - Push to remote
   - "Plan committed and pushed. What would you like to do next?"
   - "Options: 1) Start implementation 2) End session 3) Something else"
   - **WAIT for human response**
   - **Session ends here** (or human requests implementation)

## Return to Exploration

**If you realize during planning**:
- Architecture decision is wrong
- Don't understand what to build
- Need to question approach
- Something feels fundamentally off

**STOP planning. Return to exploration.**

Follow exploration mode workflow to address the fundamental questions.

---

**Remember**: Design the approach, get approval, THEN implement.

## üö® CHANGE PROTOCOL FOR THIS FILE üö®

**This file defines the planning mode process. Changing it means changing how we break down work.**

**If you think this file needs to change** (beyond example updates):

1. **STOP immediately**
2. Create change proposal document with date and description
3. Document:
   - What process you want to change
   - Why current process failed
   - What problem new process solves
   - Evidence from recent sessions
4. **DO NOT make the change**
5. Wait for human review in new session
6. Human decides if process should evolve or if drift is happening

**Better examples are fine. Process changes require review.**
