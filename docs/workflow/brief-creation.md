# BRIEF CREATION

**Purpose**: Convert human intent into structured brief through conversation.

**Note**: AI-assisted path. Briefs can also be created by humans directly or during exploration.

---

## What Is This?

**Brief creation converts**:
- Human's thoughts â†’ Structured brief
- Vague intent â†’ Clear starting mode
- "Something feels off" â†’ Specific work package

**Not for**:
- Starting implementation
- Making architectural decisions
- Creating task lists

---

## Workflow (6 Steps)

### 1. Understand Intent

**Ask**:
- "Who is this for?" (specific role/persona)
- "What problem are they experiencing?" (pain point)
- "What becomes possible when this exists?" (outcome)
- "Why does this matter now?" (urgency/context)
- "Is this about architecture, implementation, or a bug?" (mode hint)

**Listen for**:
- Uncertainty â†’ Exploration needed
- Clarity â†’ Planning/implementation ready
- Frustration â†’ Possible mission misalignment
- User impact â†’ Capture for Intent section

### 2. Load Context

**Check `docs/TAG_INDEX.json`** â†’ Identify relevant documentation tags and navigate to architectural decisions

Common mappings:
- Backend work â†’ `#api #database`
- Frontend work â†’ `#ui #components`
- Infrastructure â†’ `#deployment #security`

**Load relevant docs/context/ and docs/standards/ documentation** to understand constraints.

### 3. Draft Brief Sections

**Work through with human**:

| Section | Questions | Extract |
|---------|-----------|---------|
| **Intent** | "Who is this for?" "What problem?" "What outcome?" "Why now?" | User/persona, problem, outcome, urgency - NOT implementation details |
| **Constraints** | "What can't change?" "What must remain true?" | Mission alignment, arch decisions, tech constraints |
| **Signal** | "How will users know?" "What tests prove it?" "What ships?" | User signal, technical signal, outcome signal |
| **Open Questions** | "What don't we know yet?" "Architectural or implementation unknowns?" | Drives mode selection |

**Open Questions determines mode**:
- Architectural unknowns â†’ EXPLORATION
- Implementation unknowns â†’ PLANNING
- No unknowns â†’ IMPLEMENTATION

### 4. Write Brief

**Create**: `briefs/P[phase]_[category]_[feature].md`

**Use**: `docs/briefs/PRODUCT_BRIEF_TEMPLATE.md`

**Fill in**:
1. Status: "active"
2. CURRENT MODE: (exploration/planning/implementation)
3. Relevant Architecture Tags (from Step 2)
4. Intent, Constraints, Signal, Open Questions
5. Leave mode sections empty (filled during work)

**Naming convention**:
- **Phase**: P000 through P999 (flexible numbering based on project size)
- **Category**: Matches architecture tags (api, database, ui, etc.)
- **Feature**: Specific work unit (kebab-case)
- **Examples**: P000_api_authentication.md, P002_database_migrations.md, P010_ui_dashboard.md

### 5. Identify Mode

**From Open Questions**:

| If | Then Mode |
|----|-----------|
| Architectural unknowns | EXPLORATION |
| Implementation unknowns | PLANNING |
| No unknowns | IMPLEMENTATION |

### 6. Tell Human Next Steps

**Template**:
> "Brief created at `briefs/P[phase]_[category]_[feature].md`. Starting mode: [MODE].
>
> Ready to start now, or saving for later?"

**If start now**: Transition to mode

**If later**: Brief saved for new session

## Anti-Patterns

| Pattern | Problem | Fix |
|---------|---------|-----|
| Start implementation | "Add feature" â†’ code immediately | Create brief first, then enter mode |
| Skip Open Questions | Pretend to know everything | Be honest about unknowns, they drive work |
| Implementation in Intent | "Create UserForm with fields X, Y, Z" | Intent is WHY not WHAT: "Enable user management" |
| Skip docs/context/MISSION.md | Brief drifts from mission | Always read docs/context/MISSION.md, check alignment |
| Vague constraints | Only "follow mission" | Include specific arch decisions + tech constraints |

## Examples

### Vague Intent â†’ Exploration

**Human**: "The authentication approach doesn't feel right"

**AI**: "Who needs authentication? What problem are they facing?"

**Human**: "API consumers integrating with our service. Right now there's no clear way to authenticate - some endpoints are open, some are closed, no documentation on the auth flow."

**AI**: "What should be possible when this exists?"

**Human**: "Developers should be able to securely authenticate and understand the security model immediately."

**AI**: "Why now?"

**Human**: "Blocking v1.0 launch - we can't ship without a clear auth strategy."

**AI**: Reads docs/context/MISSION.md â†’ "What architectural questions remain?"

**Human**: "Not sure if we need session-based or token-based auth. Where does auth live architecturally?"

**Brief**:
```
Intent:
For: API consumers integrating with our service
Problem: No clear way to authenticate - some endpoints open, some closed, no docs on auth flow
Outcome: Developers can securely authenticate and understand the security model immediately
Why Now: Blocking v1.0 launch - can't ship without auth strategy

Constraints: Must support project's user model and security requirements
Signal:
- User: "Auth flow is clear and obvious"
- Technical: All endpoints protected, auth tests pass
- Outcome: Complete auth implementation shipped
Open Questions: Session-based vs token-based? Where does auth live architecturally?
```

**Mode**: EXPLORATION

### Clear Intent â†’ Planning

**Human**: "Need to implement API rate limiting"

**AI**: "Who is this for?"

**Human**: "API consumers making high-volume requests"

**AI**: "What problem are they experiencing?"

**Human**: "No rate limiting currently allows abuse - we've seen service degradation affecting all users"

**AI**: "What becomes possible when this exists?"

**Human**: "Fair usage is enforced, service remains stable under load, abusers get blocked automatically"

**AI**: "Why now?"

**Human**: "We had a production incident last week where one client overwhelmed the API"

**AI**: Checks arch â†’ "RESTful API applies. Constraints?"

**Human**: "Must work with existing auth, no new dependencies"

**AI**: "What are the unknowns?"

**Human**: "Rate limit algorithm choice, storage mechanism, distributed system handling"

**Brief**:
```
Intent:
For: API consumers making high-volume requests
Problem: No rate limiting allows abuse, potential service degradation for all users
Outcome: Fair usage enforced, service remains stable under load, abusers blocked automatically
Why Now: Production incident last week - one client overwhelmed the API

Constraints: Work with existing auth, no new dependencies
Signal:
- User: "My legitimate requests succeed, I get clear feedback if rate limited"
- Technical: API returns 429 when limit exceeded, 200 for valid requests
- Outcome: Rate limiting live in production
Open Questions: Token bucket vs sliding window? Redis or in-memory? How to handle distributed systems?
```

**Mode**: PLANNING

### Specific Intent â†’ Implementation

**Human**: "Database query fails when user has null email"

**AI**: "Who is affected?"

**Human**: "Users with optional email fields in their profile"

**AI**: "What problem are they experiencing?"

**Human**: "Their profile page crashes when email is null"

**AI**: "What becomes possible when fixed?"

**Human**: "Profile page loads correctly regardless of email presence"

**AI**: "Why now?"

**Human**: "It's affecting 15% of users right now - production bug"

**AI**: "Unknowns?"

**Human**: "Nope, just need to add null check in query"

**Brief**:
```
Intent:
For: Users with optional email fields in their profile
Problem: Database query crashes when email is null, breaking profile page
Outcome: Profile page loads correctly regardless of email presence
Why Now: Affecting 15% of users right now - production bug

Constraints: Don't break existing tests, TDD workflow
Signal:
- User: "Profile page loads without errors"
- Technical: Test "query handles null email" passes
- Outcome: Bug fixed in production
Open Questions: None
```

**Mode**: IMPLEMENTATION

## Existing Brief

**If human references existing brief**:
1. Read brief
2. Check mode
3. Transition to mode
4. Begin work

**If needs updating**:
1. Discuss changes
2. Update sections
3. Re-evaluate mode
4. Transition

---

## Key Principles

| Principle | Why |
|-----------|-----|
| Briefs â‰  Specs | Capture intent/constraints/signal/questions. That's it. |
| Open Questions = Gold | Most valuable section. Honest unknowns drive work. |
| Mode selection matters | Wrong mode = frustration. Exploration in implementation = chaos. |
| Briefs evolve | Update as work progresses. Tool, not sacred text. |

## ðŸš¨ CHANGE PROTOCOL FOR THIS FILE ðŸš¨

**This file defines how briefs get created. Changing it means changing how humans communicate intent to AI.**

**If you think this file needs to change**:

1. **STOP immediately**
2. Create change proposal document with date and description
3. Document:
   - What process you want to change
   - Why current process failed
   - What problem new process solves
   - Evidence from recent sessions
4. **DO NOT make the change**
5. Wait for human review in new session
6. Human decides if process should evolve or if drift is happening

**Template/structure updates are fine. Process changes require review.**
