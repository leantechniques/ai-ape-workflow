Finalize exploration. Capture decisions WITHOUT planning or implementation.

**CRITICAL**: Do NOT design or specify implementation. If you write "Create X with functions..." or "Phase A: Build Y..." you've drifted into planning. STOP.

## Summarize First

- What architectural question?
- What decision?
- Why this approach?

Wait for confirmation.

## Update Brief: Exploration Findings

Follow the template in the brief's Exploration Findings section.

**Self-Check**:
- [ ] Decisions documented (not implementation plans)
- [ ] Planning Input is WHAT (not HOW)
- [ ] Zero tasks, phases, or estimates

If any unchecked, revise.
